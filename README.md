# UC Berkeley Coding Bootcamp - Module 5 Challenge
## Work Day Scheduler
Code Refactor Challenge: For this assignment, I was presented with a rudimentary codebase containing the basic structure of a work day scheduler application. My task was to extend the scheduler by adding additional time-blocks dynamically and implementing the entire functionality through the script.js file. Using jQuery, I was able to dynamically generate and add time-blocks to the scheduler's layout on the web page. This approach allowed me to efficiently create multiple time-blocks programmatically, thereby reducing the need for repetitive HTML code and enhancing the project's maintainability. Furthermore, I employed jQuery to add event listeners to the saveBtns, enabling seamless interaction between users and the application. This facilitated the process of capturing user input and storing it in the browser's localStorage. jQuery also enabled me to apply and remove specific classes to HTML elements based on the current time. Throughout the project, I adhered to best practices and utilized the third-party API, dayjs, to retrieve/format the current date and time. Integrating dayjs further elevated the website's functionality and customization potential.

## User Story
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours of 9am&ndash;5pm
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist

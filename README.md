## User Story

I WANT to add important events to a daily planner

WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours of 9am&ndash;5pm
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock

THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist

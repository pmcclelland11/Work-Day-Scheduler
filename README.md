# UC Berkeley Coding Bootcamp - Module 5 Challenge
## Work Day Scheduler
Code refactor challenge: I was provided the starter code for the project which is intended to be used as a work day scheduler. The starter code only gave the skeleton for the project - I was required to add additional time-blocks to the scheduler using HTML and then write the entire script.js file to add functionality. For this assignment, I utilized jQuery to do the following tasks: add listeners to saveBtns, dynamically add/remove classes to HTML elements, and save user input to localStorage. Not only did this assignment test my understanding of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery, but it also required me to work with the third-party API dayjs, further enhancing my website's functionality.
